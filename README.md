# CryptoMonitor

## Update Price

Every 10s the server will fetch new prices from *cryptocompare* through apis with `Info` module, which lives in a process aside from the main process.

First, it will get the `coinList`, which contains all the available coins. Then, we will select the first 20 coins per the `SortOrder` and fetch their prices. Finally, new prices will be broadcasted to the browser.

## Send Email

Email will be sent to the subscriber whenever the prices of the monitored coins lift above `limit_high` or drop down below `limit_low`. This will require checking through the `coins` table, which records the users' monitoring coins.

- Invoke

  Email Service is provided through a stand-alone process, use `GenServer.cast(Email, {:send_email, prices})` to invoke. Every time new prices are fetched, the `Info` process will invoke email sending service, ie., every 10s by far.

- State

  The state of Email process is a map `%{coinid => last_send_time}`, and current checking time is *1h (3600s)*. If the interval between last send time and now is less than 1h, email won't be sent.
